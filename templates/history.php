                The lineage begins with Thomas Carter, born in 1750 in Dublin, Ireland, who devoted his life to agricultural work and died in 1815 at age 65. His son Robert Carter was born in Dublin in 1780; he became a skilled carpenter and passed away in 1852 at 72. Robert’s daughter Elizabeth, originally O’Brien, was welcomed into the world in Cork in 1810 and lived to the age of 70, dying in 1880 after raising a large family. The next generation features John Smith, born in London in 1840, who worked in the shipyards and died in 1910 at 70. His daughter Mary, née Carter, emigrated to New York in 1870, where she died in 1942 at 72. Mary’s son William Smith, born in Chicago in 1900, pursued engineering and lived until 1975, passing at age 75. His daughter Margaret was born in 1930 in Chicago and died in 2000 at 70. Margaret’s son David Johnson was born in Vancouver in 1960 and is 65 in 2025. His daughter Sarah was born in 1988 in Vancouver and is 37, while her niece Emily Johnson was born in 2010 in Toronto and is now 15. Their journey reflects broader patterns of migration.
